## Electronics Lab Inventory - LIMS

Welcome! This is our mini project for the A-1 Launchpad — a simple but useful **Inventory Management System** built to help organize and manage components in an electronics lab.

---

##  What This Project Is About

Electronics labs can get messy with so many components lying around. Our goal is to build a web-based tool that:

- Keeps track of all electronic components in the lab
- Lets students/staff request and return components
- Helps lab admins monitor usage and availability

This is a hands-on attempt at solving a real problem we’ve seen in our labs.

##  What It Can Do

Here’s what the system will be able to handle (and more as we build!):

- Add, edit, or delete components
- Track who borrowed what, and when
- Separate logins for students, staff, and admin
- Show available stock in real-time
- Search and filter parts easily
- Dashboard (optional) for quick lab insights
- 

##  What We’re Using (Tech Stack)

We’re still finalizing the exact tools, but for now, the plan is:

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript *(maybe React later)*
- **Backend**: Node.js / Express *(or Flask if we switch to Python)*
- **Database**: MongoDB / MySQL
- **Version Control**: Git + GitHub

We’ll update this section as the project grows.
